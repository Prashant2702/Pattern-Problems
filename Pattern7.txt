...Butterfly Pattern...
In this program, we are going to print out the butterfly pattern where row is started from 1 to n.
star pattern =Row no.
Space-2*n-2*Row no.
we done this program with the help of for loops.first for loop is used for the row ,second loop
is used for the Printing out the spacing in columns and last one is used for star printing.This
is for the upper pattern for the butterfly problem.we used the same code and only change-
i=n;i<=1;i--.
